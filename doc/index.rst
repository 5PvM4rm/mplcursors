Welcome to mplcursors' documentation!
=====================================

:mod:`mplcursors` provide interactive, clickable annotation for
:mod:`matplotlib`.  It is heavily inspired from :mod:`mpldatacursor`
(https://github.com/joferkington/mpldatacursor), with a much simplified API.

:mod:`mplcursors` requires Python>=3.5, :mod:`numpy`\>=1.8.0, and
:mod:`matplotlib`\>=1.5.0.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Pick one among::

    $ pip install mplcursors # from PyPI
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors # from Github

.. _basic-example:

Basic example
-------------

Basic examples work similarly to :mod:`mpldatacursor`::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import mplcursors

    data = np.outer(range(10), range(1, 5))

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    lines = ax.plot(data)
    ax.set_title("Click somewhere on a line.\nRight-click to deselect.\n"
                 "Annotations can be dragged.")

    mplcursors.cursor(lines) # or just mplcursors.cursor()

    plt.show()

.. image:: /images/basic.png

The `cursor` convenience function makes a collection of artists selectable.
Specifically, its first argument can either be a list of artists or axes (in
which case all artists in each of the axes become selectable); or one can just
pass no argument, in which case all artists in all figures become selectable.
Other :class:`arguments <mplcursors.Cursor>` (which are all keyword-only)
allow for basic customization of the `Cursor`’s behavior; please refer to the
constructor's documentation.

.. _activation-by-environment-variable:

Activation by environment variable
----------------------------------

It is possible to use :mod:`mplcursors` without modifying *any* source
code: setting the :envvar:`MPLCURSORS` environment variable to a
JSON-encoded dict will patch :func:`plt.show <matplotlib.pyplot.show>` to
automatically call `cursor` before displaying the figure (with the passed
keyword arguments, if any).  Typical settings include::

    $ MPLCURSORS={} python foo.py

and::

    $ MPLCURSORS='{"hover": 1}' python foo.py

Note that this will only work if :mod:`mplcursors` has been installed, not if
it is simply added to the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.

.. _default-ui:

Default UI
----------

- A left click on a line (a point, for plots where the data points are not
  connected) creates a draggable annotation there.  Only one annotation is
  displayed (per `Cursor` instance), except if the ``multiple`` keyword
  argument was set.
- A right click on an existing annotation will remove it.
- Clicks do not trigger annotations if the zoom or pan tool are active.  It is
  possible to bypass this by *double*-clicking instead.
- For annotations pointing to lines or images, :kbd:`Shift-Left` and
  :kbd:`Shift-Right` move the cursor "left" or "right" by one data point.  For
  annotations pointing to images, :kbd:`Shift-Up` and :kbd:`Shift-Down` are
  likewise available.
- :kbd:`d` toggles the visibility of the existing annotation(s).
- :kbd:`t` toggles whether the `Cursor` is active at all (if not, no event
  other than re-activation) is propagated.

These bindings are all customizable via `Cursor`’s ``bindings`` keyword
argument.

.. _customization:

Customization
-------------

Instead of providing a host of keyword arguments in `Cursor`’s constructor,
:mod:`mplcursors` represents selections as `Selection` objects (essentially,
namedtuples) and lets you hook into their addition and removal.

Specifically, a `Selection` has the following fields:

    - :attr:`artist`: the selected artist,
    - :attr:`target`: the point picked within the artist; if a point is picked
      on a `Line2D <matplotlib.lines.Line2D>`, the index of the point is
      available as the :attr:`target.index` sub-attribute (for more details,
      see :ref:`selection-indices`).
    - :attr:`dist`: the distance from the point clicked to the :attr:`target`
      (mostly used to decide which ).
    - :attr:`annotation`: a `matplotlib Annotation
      <matplotlib.text.Annotation>` object.
    - :attr:`extras`: an additional list of artists, that will be removed
      whenever the main :attr:`annotation` is deselected.

For certain classes of artists, additional information about the picked point
is available in the :attr:`target.index` sub-attribute:

    - For `Line2D <matplotlib.lines.Line2D>`\s, it contains the index of the
      selected point (see :ref:`selection-indices` for more details, especially
      regarding step plots).
    - For `LineCollection <matplotlib.collections.LineCollection>`\s, it
      contains a pair: the index of the selected line, and the index within the
      line, as defined above.

Thus, in order to customize, e.g., the annotation text, one can call::

    lines = ax.plot(range(3), range(3), "o")
    labels = ["a", "b", "c"]
    cursor = mplcursors.cursor(lines)
    cursor.connect(
        "add", lambda sel: sel.annotation.set_text(labels[sel.target.index]))

Whenever a point is selected (resp. deselected), the ``"add"`` (resp.
``"remove"``) event is triggered and the registered callbacks are executed,
with the `Selection` as only argument.  Here, the only callback updates the
text of the annotation to a per-point label. (``cursor.connect("add")`` can
also be used as a decorator to register a callback, see below for an example.)
For an example using :mod:`pandas`’ :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>`\s,
see :file:`examples/dataframe.py`.

For additional customizations of the position and appearance of the annotation,
see :file:`examples/bar_example.py` and :file:`examples/change_popup_color.py`.

Callbacks can also be used to make additional changes to the figure when
a selection occurs.  For example, the following snippet (extracted from
:file:`examples/multi_highlight_example.py`) ensures that whenever an artist is
selected, another artist that has been "paired" with it (via the ``pairs`` map)
also gets selected::

    @cursor.connect("add")
    def on_add(sel):
        sel.extras.append(cursor.add_highlight(pairs[sel.artist]))

Note that the paired artist will also get de-highlighted when the "first"
artist is deselected.

.. note::
   When the callback is fired, the position of the annotating text is
   temporarily set to ``(np.nan, np.nan)``.  This allows us to track whether
   a callback explicitly sets this position, and, if none does, automatically
   compute a suitable position.

.. _selection-indices:

Selection indices
-----------------

When picking a point on a "normal" line, the target index has an integer part
equal to the index of segment it is on, and a fractional part that indicates
where the point is within that segment.

Such an approach does not make sense for step plots (i.e., created by
``plt.step`` or ``plt.plot(..., drawstyle="steps-...")``.  In this case, we
return a special :class:`Index` object, with attributes :attr:`int` (the
segment index), :attr:`x` (how far the point has advanced in the ``x``
direction) and :attr:`y` (how far the point has advanced in the ``y``
direction).  See :file:`examples/step.py` for an example.

.. _complex-plots:

Complex plots
-------------

Some complex plots, such as contour plots, may be partially supported,
or not at all.  Typically, it is because they do not subclass `Artist
<matplotlib.artist.Artist>`, and thus appear to `cursor` as a collection of
independent artists (each contour level, in the case of contour plots).

It is usually possible, again, to hook the ``"add"`` signal to provide
additional information in the annotation text.  See :file:`examples/coutour.py`
for an example.
